[yaml-file](/K8s/YAML/Services/nginx-rs.yaml)

* Create Pod for alpine & deploy
[yaml-file](/K8s/YAML/Services/alpine-os.yaml)

![Pods Output](./Images/Capture6.PNG) 

* Create Service for Replica set of nginx & deploy
[yaml-file](/K8s/YAML/Services/nginx-svc.yaml)

* service is running with an IP address - 

![SVC output](./Images/Capture7.PNG)

* now login to alpine pod using below command
```
kubectl exec -it alpine-pod -- /bin/sh
```

* after installing curl in alpine with apk, 
	* try pinging the svc ip address, it will fail

* now try to get the html file using 

```
curl http://<svc-ip-add>
```

* We will get the HTML file back from one of the nginx pods in RS
